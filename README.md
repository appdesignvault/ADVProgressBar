ADVProgressBar for iOS
======================

Define the `ADVPercentProgressBar` class, that is a custom progress bar
that comes in multiple colors.
It shows a display above the bar that depicts the amount of the task that has
completed. This indication may be displayed as the whole value or its percentage.

The `ADVPercentProgressBar` class is deployed together a demo app to show
various use case scenarios. They have been developed as an Xcode 4.5.2 project
targeting iOS 5.0.

This work has been derived from
https://github.com/appdesignvault/ADVProgressBar.

Changes relate to the following topics:
- Let configure the range of the values represented by the progress bar.
- Choose the way the amount of completed task is displayed: percentage or integral.
- Allow variable size.
- Add support to `initWithFrame` and `initWithCoder` so that the view controller
  can add `ADVPercentProgressBar` class via a nib (storyboard) or programatically.
- Annotate source code files an according to Doxygen in order to auto generate
  design documentation.
- A tutorial has been added.
